HomebaseTweaks is a small project for adding missing functionality from
homebase.no, e.g. automatic record your beloved series instead of having to
record each program every weak.

Requirements
------------

* Python - http://python.org

  2.7.1 were used during development, but others would hopefully work as well.

* BeautifulSoup - http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/

  3.2.0 were used during development, but others would hopefully work as well.


The code is GPLv3, which means you're allowed to freely copy and modify it for
your needs, as long as you share it with the same licence. Please contact me if
you have any questions:
